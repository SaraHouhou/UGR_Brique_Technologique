# To get a feel for what kind of features your CNN has learned, one fun thing to do is to visualize how an input gets transformed as it goes through the model.

# You can pick a random image from the training set, and then generate a figure where each row is the output of a layer, and each image in the row is a specific filter in that output feature map. Rerun this cell to generate intermediate representations for a variety of training images.
